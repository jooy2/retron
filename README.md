## Build

**Retron** can build targeting Windows 10 or later, macOS 14.x or later, and major Linux distributions.

```shell
# For Windows (.exe, .appx)

$ npm run build:linux
```

The built packages can be found in `release/{version}` location.

### Build settings for projects that use Native Node modules

For projects that use the **Native Node Module**, add the following script to your `package.json`: When installing dependencies, `electron-builder` will take care of any modules that require rebuilding.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "electron-builder install-app-deps"
  }
}
```

### What do I need to do for a multi-platform build?

**macOS** is recommended if you want to build multiple platforms simultaneously on one platform. Because it can be configured with just a few very simple settings.

You can perform multi-platform builds at once with the following command. Alternatively, you can just do it for the OS you want via the individual build commands above.

```shell
$ npm run build
```
